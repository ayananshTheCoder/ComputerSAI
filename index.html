                E-commerce (electronic commerce) is the buying and selling of goods and services, or the transmitting of funds or data, over an electronic network, primarily the internet. 
                <br><br>
                These business transactions occur either as business-to-business (B2B), business-to-consumer (B2C), consumer-to-consumer or consumer-to-business.
                <br><br>
                In the last decade, widespread use of e-commerce platforms i.e. <a href="https://amazon.com">Amazon</a> and <a href="https:/ebay.com">eBay</a> contributed to substantial growth in online retail.

            <p>
                E-commerce is powered by the internet, where customers can access an online store to browse through, and place orders for products or services via their own devices.
                <br><br>
                As the order is placed, the customer's web browser will communicate back and forth with the server hosting the online store website. 
                <br><br>
                Data pertaining to the order will then be relayed to a central computer known as the order manager -- then forwarded to databases that manage inventory levels, a merchant system that manages payment information (using applications such as PayPal), and a bank computer -- before circling back to the order manager.
